# SonoGlyph
SonoGlyph is a browser-based audio steganography lab that hides images within sound. It uses spectrogram-domain synthesis and Griffinâ€“Lim reconstruction to embed visual patterns into precise frequency bands, preserving audio quality while producing readable, ghostlike watermarks in the spectrum.
